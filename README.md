# Simple Math Interpreter

SimpleMathInterpreter (temporally name) is a simple interpreter for simple math expressions.

# Features & Intentions on This Project

It's written (for now) in C++, it's got a very simple and clunky lexer and parser, and I'm implementing the interpreter.

This is a project for me to learn. So, in the future, I will make a real programming language, compiled and everything.
